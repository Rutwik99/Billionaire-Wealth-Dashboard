# Billionaire Wealth Dashboard

## Introduction
Welcome to the Billionaire Wealth Analysis project! This project aims to provide insights into billionaire wealth across industries, regions, and demographics through intuitive visualizations. By uncovering trends, patterns, and key correlations, our dashboard informs strategic decisions and identifies opportunities in the global wealth landscape.

## Mission
The mission of this project is to analyze billionaire wealth data and present it in an accessible and insightful manner. The goal is to help policymakers, economists, and other stakeholders understand the economic disparities and policy implications associated with billionaire wealth.

## Datasets
The dataset used in this project provides an overview of global billionaires, detailing their net worth, industries, and personal attributes. It includes socio-economic indicators for each billionaireâ€™s country. Key attributes include country, industries, self-made status, age, gender, CPI, and other economic factors.

## Insights
- Country-wise Analysis: Analyze the distribution of self-made and inherited billionaires across different countries. For instance, India has many inherited billionaires compared to China.
- Industry-wise Analysis: Examine the prevalence of self-made billionaires in various industries, with a focus on the technology sector versus diversified industries.
- Net Worth Analysis: Compare billionaires across different net worth classes, highlighting that lower-class billionaires often come from finance, while richer billionaires dominate the technology sector.
- Socio-economic Analysis: View socio-economic indicators such as CPI, education enrollment, and tax rates to understand the conditions in each country.
